K-means is one of the most essential algorithms in data mining, but its practical application is often complicated by the trade-off between computational efficiency and the quality of the final clustering. The widely-used Lloyd's algorithm is fast but can converge to suboptimal solutions, while alternatives like Hartigan's algorithm can produce better results at a significantly higher and sometimes unpredictable computational cost.
This thesis introduces and evaluates a novel heuristic, "extended-Hartigan," designed to bridge this gap by reducing the computational complexity of Hartigan's method while retaining its accuracy. The proposed algorithm identifies all potentially beneficial point reassignments in a given state, following Hartigan's fashion, and applies them in a single batch update, eventually falling back to some "safe" updates to guarantee cost reduction at each iteration. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing Extended Hartigan, along with hybrid "mixed-mode" variants, against the classical Lloyd's and Hartigan's algorithms across several benchmark datasets (A-Sets, Bridge, and House) using various initialization techniques.
Results demonstrate that the proposed methods consistently find clusterings with a lower final cost than Lloyd's algorithm, especially on complex datasets. Critically, extended-Hartigan avoids the computational instability of the standard Hartigan algorithm, showing a cost profile closer to the efficient Lloyd's baseline and successfully avoiding the extreme cost increases observed in the standard method on certain datasets. The findings indicate that the extended-Hartigan algorithm is a robust and efficient alternative that successfully balances the trade-off between solution quality and computational expense, offering a practical and powerful alternative for k-means clustering.

K-means is one of the most widely-used algorithms to perform clustering and exploratory data analysis, since it allows identifying relevant patterns in data. Its objective is to partition a set of observations into a predetermined number of clusters, by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). However, this optimization problem is NP-hard, necessitating the use of heuristic algorithms for practical applications. The most common heuristic, Lloyd's algorithm, is simple and efficient, but at the same time it is highly susceptible to converging to suboptimal local minima, with its performance being heavily dependent on the centroids' initial positions. While alternatives, such as Hartigan's algorithm, have been proven to find better (lower-cost) solutions, they are often significantly slower and more computationally intensive.

This thesis introduces and evaluates a novel heuristic, "extended-Hartigan", designed to bridge this gap by reducing the computational complexity of the standard Hartigan's method while retaining its ability to find high-quality clusterings. The proposed algorithm deviates from the standard single-point update rule. Instead, it first identifies all candidate data points whose reassignment would individually decrease the total cost, following Hartigan's procedure, and then attempts to apply this entire list of reassignments in a single "unsafe" batch update. If this aggressive update fails to lower the overall cost, the algorithm reverts the changes and proceeds in a "safe" mode, accepting a limited subset of non-conflicting reassignments to guarantee a monotonic cost reduction in that iteration.

To validate this approach, we conduct an empirical study comparing extended-Hartigan and its hybrid "mixed-mode" variants against the classical Lloyd's and Hartigan's algorithms. The evaluation spans several benchmark datasets, which feature diverse numbers of samples, dimensions, and cluster counts. The comparison is performed using multiple initialization techniques, including maximin, k-means++, and greedy k-means++, and performance is assessed based on the final cost, computational efficiency, and clustering stability. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods consistently find clusterings with a lower final cost than Lloyd's algorithm, achieving a significant cost reduction on the most complex datasets. Moreover, extended-Hartigan avoids the computational instability inherent in the standard Hartigan algorithm, showing a cost profile closer to the efficient Lloyd's baseline and successfully preventing extreme cost increases. The findings indicate that the extended-Hartigan algorithm is a robust and efficient alternative that successfully balances the trade-off between solution quality and computational expense, offering a practical and powerful alternative for k-means clustering.
